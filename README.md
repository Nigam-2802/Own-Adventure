# 🧭 Choose Your Own Adventure Game

## 🎯 Objective
A text-based adventure game that allows users to navigate through different storylines based on their choices. Each decision leads to unique paths and endings, creating an interactive storytelling experience.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Conditional statements (`if/elif/else`)
- User input handling (`input()`)
- Loops and nested decisions

- Some choices lead to winning, others to losing — it's all about the decisions you make!

## 💡 Highlights
- Modular design: easy to add new story branches
- Beginner-friendly for understanding Python logic flow
- Enhances storytelling with simple but engaging structure

## 📁 Files
